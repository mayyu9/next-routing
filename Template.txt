if we want to keep some state data in between the components then add a state in the layout.tsx file.
if we navigate to any other route within that app route. then this state value will be persisted, because 
while navigation layout.tsx page will not be re-rendered completely. only the portion of the page gets re-rendered, excluding the common portions
here in the above scenario layout is common for entire route folder.

refer to example in auth.
1. define a state inside layot file of auth, this value is passed to all the pages in the auth.

Secanrios where we need the entire page to get refreshed. We can make use of template file to acheive this

Templates:

1. Templates are similar to layouts, they wrap each child layout or page

2. But with templates, when a user navigates between routes that share a template, a new instance of the component is mounted,
    DOM elements are recreated, state is not preserved and effects are re-synchronized.

3. A template can be defined by exporting a default react component from template.jsx or template.tsx

4. similar to layouts, template also should accept a children prop which will render the nested segments in the route.

5. A folder can contain both layout and template file. in this scenario below is the order which it gets rendered
    .layout
    . template
    .page
