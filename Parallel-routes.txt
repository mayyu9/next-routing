Parallel routes:

It is an advance routing mechanism that allows for the simultaneous rendering of multiple pages within the same layout.

1. Parallel routes in nextjs are defined using a feature known as slots

2. slots help to structure our content in modular fashion

3. to define a slot, we use the '@folder' convention

4. Each slot is then passed as prop to its corresponding 'layout.tsx' file.

Parallel route benefits:

1. A clear benefit of parallel routes is their ability to split single layout into various slots, making the code more manageable.
2. independent route handling
3. sub-navigation

Independent Route Handling:
1. Each slot of your layout, such as user or revenue or notifications can have their own loading state or errors 
2. This granular control is particularly beneficial in scenarios where different sections of the page load at varying speeds or encounter unique errors.

Sub-navigation routes:

1. Each slot of your dashboard can essentially function as a mini application, complete with its own navigation and state management.
2. This is especially useful in complex applications such as our dashboard where different sections serve distinct purposes.
