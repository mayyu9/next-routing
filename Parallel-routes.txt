Parallel routes:

It is an advance routing mechanism that allows for the simultaneous rendering of multiple pages within the same layout.

refer comples-dashboard folder.

1. Parallel routes in nextjs are defined using a feature known as slots

2. slots help to structure our content in modular fashion

3. to define a slot, we use the '@folder' convention

4. Each slot is then passed as prop to its corresponding 'layout.tsx' file.

Parallel route benefits:

1. A clear benefit of parallel routes is their ability to split single layout into various slots, making the code more manageable.
2. independent route handling
3. sub-navigation

Independent Route Handling:
1. Each slot of your layout, such as user or revenue or notifications can have their own loading state or errors 
2. This granular control is particularly beneficial in scenarios where different sections of the page load at varying speeds or encounter unique errors.

Sub-navigation routes:

1. Each slot of your dashboard can essentially function as a mini application, complete with its own navigation and state management.
2. This is especially useful in complex applications such as our dashboard where different sections serve distinct purposes.

unmatched routes in sub-navigation:

Page reload:
1.next js immediately searches for a default.tsx file within each unmatched slot.
2. the presence of This file is critical, as it provides the default content that next js will render in the user interface.
3. if this default.tsx file is missing in any of the unmatched slots for the current route, Next js will render a 404 error.

for the above scenario, navigate to complex-dashboard/archived and then reload the page. it will result in 404 error as there is no default.tsx

default.tsx:
1. the default.tsx file in next js serves as a fallback to render the content when the framework cannot retrieve a slot's active state from the current URL.

2. You have complete freedom to define the UI fro unmatched routes: you can mirror the content found in page.tsx or craft an entirely custom view.
