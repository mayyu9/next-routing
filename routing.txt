In this routing project, we have few scenarios

s1:
basic routing,home page implementation
for routing every project should have app folder, under this folder all the page.js / page.tsx will act as route

s2: 
create 2 pages for about and profile.
create a about folder under app, create a page.tsx. this page will be served when run the app alogn with
"/about"

create a profile folder under app, create a page.tsx. this page will be served when run the app alogn with
"/profile"

s3: neseted routing, we use blog folder for this,
we trying to acheive 
localhost:3000/blog/first, localhost:3000/blog/second

s4: Dynamic Routes
passing data from url and reading in the components
for the baove scenario, we have used products folder
in order to pass the and read those props, [productId] this format is used so that next js understands that
it is for passing data

s5: nested dynamic Routes
for this use the product folder. here we are trying to acheive
localhost:3000/product/1/reviews/100
we have to read the data from the url

s6: Catch-all segment
for this we use docs folder
consider a scenario in which we have nested folders. every feature we have multiple concepts. all share the same layout structure.
we end up having multiple number of files. this can be solved by using the dynamic [featureId] route.
still we have same issue with concepts files as well, this can be solved by using the dynamic [conceptId] route
this is called  [...slug] folder where we can read both the featureId and conceptId
