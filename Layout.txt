Layouts:
A page is UI that is unique to a route

A layout is ui that is shared between multiple pages in the app.

Next js auot generates layout.tsx file, even if that file is deleted it will be auto generated on starting the app

How to create layouts?
1. exporting a react component from layout.js or layout.tsx
2. that component should accept a children prop that will be populated with a child page during rendering.


Nested Layouts:
in order to have custom layout for any specific page route. add a layout.js/tsx file in that folder.
refer product folder

Route Group Layout:
1. uses of route group, to organize the project in such a manner that doesn't affect the url.
2. To selectively apply a layout to a certain segments while leaving other unchanged

we try this on the auth folder, we already have route group for this folder.
1. create a folder (with-auth-layout) and move login and register folder into this folder.
2. create a layout.tsx file, this will rendered when we access the route.
