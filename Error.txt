Error.tsx is a special file, which will wrap the routes inside the page to provide fallback screen.

1. It Automatically wrap a route segment and its nested children in React Error Boundary

2. create error UI tailored to specific segments using the file system hierachy to adjust granularity 

3. isolate errors to affected segments while keeping the rest of the application functional.

4. Add functionality to attempt to recover from an error without a full page reload.

Handling Errors in Nested Route:

1. Errors bubble up to the closet parent error Boundary
2. an error.tsx file will cater all to all the errors for all its nested child segments.
3. By positioning error.tsx file at different levels in the nested folders of a route, you can acheive more granular level of error handling.

Handling Errors in Layouts:

The error boundary will not catch the error in layouts because its nested inside the layout component.
